  ## About

  The Weather Forecast app is a fleshed out application built with front and backend technologies, that utilizes 3rd party apis provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to display a 5 day weather forecast for any city that is entered in the search bar! The website will also save any search you make to a search history to make it easier to revisit forecasts!
